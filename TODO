general:

 * Soyuz, which runs many services, (database, subtracker endpoint,
   24web, AFS, feeder) is globally overloaded; it is not clear which
   (if any) single service is faulty, although 24web and the feeder
   are good candidates.

subtracker:

 * During 2018 we experience random crashes, which we did not see in
   2017 (essentially the same program, although on a different
   hardware).

24web:

 * Would be nice to implement last partial result (not only current),
   perhaps trying to fix common turn change problems.
 * "(gol in pi√π all'ora che devono segnare i Fisici per recuperare i
   Fisici)"
 * Show turns queue (it is useful to know who plays next)

gui.py:

 * Advantage phases
 * Beginning and ending of the match

photocells:
 * Didn't work well in 2018.
 
subuttons:
 * At some point in 2018 they produced multiple events with one single press.
   This was fixed limiting the number of almost-simultaneous events to one,
   but the cause of the problem is unknown.
