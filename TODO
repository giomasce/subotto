general:

 * Soyuz, which runs many services, (database, subtracker endpoint,
   24web, AFS, feeder) is globally overloaded; it is not clear which
   (if any) single service is faulty, although 24web and the feeder
   are good candidates.

subtracker:

 * During 2018 we experience random crashes, which we did not see in
   2017 (essentially the same program, although on a different
   hardware).

24web:

 * Would be nice to implement last partial result (not only current),
   perhaps trying to fix common turn change problems.

   Fisici)"

gui.py:

 * Advantage phases
 * Beginning and ending of the match
