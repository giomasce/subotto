HOW TO SET THINGS ON THE DATABASE
---------------------------------

 * Set sched_begin and sched_end well in advance of the match. They
   are required for the initial countdown.

 * Do NOT set begin or end before resp. the beginning and the end of
   the match. If they are set, this means that the match has already
   begun or ended.

 * Set name, team_*_id, year and place. Do not forget team_*_id and
   year, because they are used by the match managing software or by
   the live feeder.

 * team_*_captain and team_*_deputy can be set after the match.

 * When the match begins, set begin. When it ends, set end.


In website_feeder.py set match_id and old_matches_id. Do not include
match_id in old_matches_id.

PROBABLY: For 24web, the matches that are listed in the past editions
statistics are those which have all the year, captains and deputies
fields set.

24web also hardcodes in files/js/score.js the current year.
